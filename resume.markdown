I'm Aaron, a Supply Chain and Logistics professional turned Software engineer. I'm well versed in JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Express, Python, and a host of other frameworks and languages. My interests are in building things from the visualization phase into a tangible product. I simply enjoy merging the two worlds of business and technology together. The internet has been an amazing place for me since I was a child, and I'm quite intrigued with how I can make the next young Aaron feel the same way that I do about it. I'm looking for a role that pushes for growth, both personally and professionally.
